# UnChartered-Territory

Application for parents and other community members to view data about charter schools in the Nashville, TN area. Users can create a profile page, add/delete from a personalized list of schools, and view detailed information about individual schools. The data was collected with a web scraper I built using NodeJS (https://github.com/tombler/school-web-scraper). Application is a work-in-progress, stay tuned for further drafts.
